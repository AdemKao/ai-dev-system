# Context Index

> Lightweight routing table for context loading. **Read this first, load others as needed.**

## Quick Route

Load **only** the files relevant to your current task:

| Task | Load These Files |
|------|------------------|
| **Writing code** | `standards/code-quality.md` |
| **API development** | `standards/openapi.md` + `workflows/contract-driven.md` |
| **Database design** | `standards/dbml.md` |
| **Writing tests** | `workflows/bdd-tdd.md` (or frontend/backend specific) |
| **Code review** | `workflows/code-review.md` |
| **UI/UX work** | `skills/ui-ux/SKILL.md` |
| **Documentation** | `standards/documentation.md` |
| **Git operations** | `workflows/git-workflow.md` |
| **Large features** | `workflows/stacked-development.md` |
| **Delegating tasks** | `workflows/delegation.md` |

## Stack-Specific Loading

**Only load stack files when user specifies a stack or it's detected from project.**

| Stack | When to Load | Files |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| `react-typescript` | `.tsx` files, React project | `stacks/react-typescript/standards/` |
| `php-laravel` | `.php` files, Laravel project | `stacks/php-laravel/standards/` |
| `node-express` | Express app detected | `stacks/node-express/standards/` |

### Stack Detection

```
If package.json contains "react" → react-typescript
If composer.json contains "laravel" → php-laravel
If package.json contains "express" → node-express
```

---

## Loading Rules

### ✅ DO

- Load **1-2 relevant files** per task
- Check index first, then load specific files
- Load stack files only when stack is clear
- Load skills only when triggered

### ❌ DON'T

- Load all standards at once
- Load all workflows at once
- Load unrelated stack files
- Pre-load "just in case"

## Example Loading Scenarios

### Scenario: "Create a new API endpoint"

```
1. Load: standards/openapi.md (API design)
2. Load: workflows/contract-driven.md (workflow)
3. If Laravel: Load stacks/php-laravel/skills/controller/SKILL.md
4. If Express: Load stacks/node-express/skills/api-endpoint/SKILL.md
```

### Scenario: "Fix this bug"

```
1. Load: skills/debug/SKILL.md
2. Maybe: standards/code-quality.md (if code changes needed)
```

### Scenario: "Build a login page"

```
1. Load: skills/ui-ux/SKILL.md
2. If React: Load stacks/react-typescript/standards/react.md
```

### Scenario: "Review this PR"

```
1. Load: workflows/code-review.md
2. Load: skills/code-review/SKILL.md
```

### Scenario: "Implement large feature with multiple PRs"

```
1. Load: workflows/stacked-development.md
2. Load: skills/feature-decompose/SKILL.md
3. If parallel agents: Load skills/worktree-agent/SKILL.md
```

## Token Budget Guideline

| Task Complexity | Max Files to Load |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Simple (fix typo, small change) | 0-1 |
| Medium (new feature, component) | 1-2 |
| Complex (architecture, multi-file) | 2-3 |
| Major (new system, refactor) | 3-4 |

**Target: Keep context loading under 20KB per task.**
